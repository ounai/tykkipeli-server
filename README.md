# tykkipeli-server
*Tykist√∂johtajana valttejasi ovat ballistiikkaopit ja nopeus. Huomioi tuuli!*

This is a Node.js server implementation for the Aapeli/Playforia classic cannon game. A slightly modified game client (release TBA) is used.

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**  
Actual gameplay is currently only implemented in the [prototype server](old/testServer.js), which does work but is incredibly hacky and does not handle most edge cases (like connection problems) very well.  
The proper implementation is coming along :)
