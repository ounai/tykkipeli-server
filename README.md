# tykkipeli-server
Node.js server implementation for the Aapeli/Playforia classic cannon game.

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**  
Actual gameplay is currently only implemented in the [prototype server](old/testServer.js), which does fully work but is incredibly hacky and does not handle most edge cases (like connection problems) very well.  
The proper implementation is coming along :)
